# Batch-Farm-Simulator

This is a farm simulator game written in batch. I havent really touched it in a year and a half other than some recent fixes. I did lots of testing, so all the code now is about 90% bug free.

The code is around 60% complete from what it was originaly inteaded to do. A good refractoring would be nice as this was made with poor programing practises. Although not necessary for the final 40%.
